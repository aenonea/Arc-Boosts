## Description

<p style="text-align:justify">
  The aim of this boost is to simplify DeviantArt’s interface.<br>
  <br>
  I use DeviantArt in much the same way as I use Pinterest: my only interest is to find inspiration and images that I enjoy looking at. I don’t create, don’t want to buy anything and don’t want to be part of groups. So I’ve removed most of these features, which I feel only make the site more complex than it needs to be. As I don’t wish to become a Core member, I’ve also removed the far too numerous banners inviting me to “Upgrade to Core”. These tweaks give a much simpler look to DeviantArt and let images and my wallet breath.
